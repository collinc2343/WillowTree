# The Namegame: iOS

Leading scientists have proven, via science, that learning your coworkers names while starting a new job is useful. Your test project is to make it happen! The api is located at [https://willowtreeapps.com/api/v1.0/profiles/](https://willowtreeapps.com/api/v1.0/profiles/).


## Your mission

Present the user with six faces and ask them to identify the listed name. To spruce things up, implement a few features of your choice.

1. Stat tracking. How many correct / incorrect attempts did the user make? How long does it take on average for a person to identify the subject?
2. Spruce up transitions and image loading.  Don't let images pop in and show the user that loading is happening
3. Game modes:
    * Mat(t) Mode. Roughly 90% of our co-workers are named Mat(t), so add a challenge mode where you only present the users with A Mat(t).
    * Reverse mode: Show one face with 5 names. Ask the user to identify the correct name.
4. Hint mode. As people wait, faces disappear until only the correct one is left.
5. Team mode. The api returns people who used to work here too. Current team members have titles and former team members don't.
5. Insert your own idea here!


## Conclusion

We have provided you with a skeleton to get you started.
